2. Explore the schema and insert your own test data if needed.  
3. Example queries:  

```sql
-- Get top posts by engagement
SELECT * FROM vw_post_rankings ORDER BY rank LIMIT 5;

-- See engagement per post
SELECT * FROM vw_post_engagement;

-- Most active users
-- (likes + comments made)
SELECT u.username, COUNT(l.*) + COUNT(c.*) AS total_interactions
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN likes l ON l.user_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN comments c ON c.user_id = u.user_id
GROUP BY u.username
ORDER BY total_interactions DESC;
